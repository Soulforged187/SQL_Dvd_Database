DVD Database
Project Information
The goal of this project is to export data from our primary database into a new aggregation. We should be able to answer some real-world business questions from reports generated using our newly aggregated data.

The real-world business question that we want to answer with our reports is what are our best performing titles every month. The detailed aggregate section will contain all rentals placed with their rental date and rental price. Through this data we will be able generate a monthly top 10 with sum totals for each film.

Business Use Cases
The detailed section of the report will allow us to have a runing log of each rental. The biggest use for the detailed section is all of the sub reports that we can run off of it. For example we can create top 10 rentals per day, week, month, year, or all time. We can also generate reports to find the weakest performing titles as well. Our main summary in this scenario will be top 10 rentals of the month.

Datafreshness
Our data should be refreshed weekly so that we can run up to date weekly reports. Running the refresh daily would be a burdon to our database and should only be done if requested.
