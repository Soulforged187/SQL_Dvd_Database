DVD Database
Project Information

The goal of this project is to export data from our primary database into a new aggregation. We should be able to answer some real-world business questions from reports generated using our newly aggregated data.

The real-world business question that we want to answer with our reports is who are our best performing sales people, this can be determined by days, weeks, months or lifetime.

- Creation of tables to hold a summary of data and a table to pull the primary information from. 
- Extract the data required from at least two tables within a predetermined database. 
- Transform the data into a new format. 
- Create a trigger and associated function. 
- Create a stored procedure to refresh the data of both tables.
